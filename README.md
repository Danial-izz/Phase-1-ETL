# Phase-1-ETL
This will be a reproducible ETL Pipeline for a stock data. However, the skeleton or the framework of this ETL pipeline can be use for multiple ETL processess.
This is to promote modularity, reproducibility and also collaboration. 
This project is also performed by 3 individuals to showcase the collaborative sentiment of this project. Kinda cool ain it.
